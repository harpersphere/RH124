* Chapter 3. Manage Files from the Command Line

*** Fil-system Hierarchy

Files are organized in a single inverted tree known as file-system hierarchy, which is an inverted tree.

/ -> bin, boot, dev, etc, home, root, run, sbin, tmp, usr, var

home -> users folders

usr -> bin, local, sbin, tmp

var -> tmp

the / directory is the root directory.

*** Terms to describe fs dir contents

- Static: content remains unchanged until edited or reconfig

- Dynamic/variable: might be modified by active process

- Persistent: remains after reboot (config files)

- Runtime: from a process or system, deleted on reboot

*** FS dir utility

| Location | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| /boot    | Files to start boot process                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| /dev     | Special device files that system uses to access hardware                                                                                                                                                             |
| /etc     | System-specific config files                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| /home    | Where regular users stores data and config files                                                                                                                                                                     |
| /root    | Where root user stores data and config files                                                                                                                                                                         |
| /run     | Runtime data for processes that started since last boot. Processes ID files and lock files. Contents re-created on reboot                                                                                            |
| /tmp     | A world-writabble space for temp files. Files not accessed, changed or modified for 10 days are automatically deleted.                                                                                               |
| /usr     | Installed software, shared libraries dir. Significant subdirectories are /usr/bin (user commands), /usr/sbin (sysadmin commands) and /usr/local (locally customized software)                                        |
| /var     | System-specific var data that should persist between boots. Files that dinamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content might be found under /var |

*** IMPORTANT

In RHEL 7 and later, four older directories in / have identical contents to their counterparts in /usr:

- /bin and /usr/bin
- /sbin and /usr/sbin
- /lib and /usr/lib
- /lib64 and /usr/lib64
